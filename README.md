Window Scaling<br>
<li>I understand how to changed the scale based on window size, but I would rather put more  effort into a project that is more benefitial</li>
<li> If  you can the window scale while not on the opening screen, it will look weird since I updated some elements when ever the scale changes, however you arent supposed to change the scale while the game is running</li>
